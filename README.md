# re-frame + ClojureScript Talk

Slides and code for my talk about using [re-frame] and [ClojureScript].

Presented at the [Houston Functional Programmer's Meetup, March 2019](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Functional-Programmers/events/znbbqqyzfbbc/).

## Talk Abstract

[re-frame] is a popular [ClojureScript] library used to write single-page
applications (SPAs) using [React.js].

It combines some simple ideas - immutable data and pure functions - with the
power of Clojure to make complex web applications manageable at scale.

- Do your clients insist on having a user interface that is full of messy state?
- Have you ever struggled with a large JavaScript codebase?
- Does the phrase "modify the webpack config" give you nightmares?
- Curious whether all the hype about ClojureScript is real?
- Do you like pure functions and data?

If any of the above rings true then this talk is for you!

In this talk I will go over some ClojureScript basics, discuss re-frame
concepts, and then we can build a small web application using re-frame.
